The next facebook, using a lot of code from https://github.com/megaboi2005/bark-it


# The Premise:
* Create a forum based website focused for schools.
* Connect with different people with custom forums for schools.
* Create specific forums for individual subjects (Math, english, history, AP, IB, Niche subjects[pet grooming idk])
* Add custom chat features to each subject and school 
* Allow customizable features for each school forum (Add new forums within the forum, etc)
* Custom webpage for yourself
